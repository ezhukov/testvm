# testvm
Rebuilding reverse build dependencies of a package

### Prerequisites

At least the following packages need to be installed:
 * qemu-kvm
 * ansible
 * vmdebootstrap

### How to use

    $ ansible-playbook -K -i invent book.yml
    $ ansible-playbook -i invent testvm.yml --extra-vars package=your-package-name

### Known limitations

 * currently only architecture type 'all' is supported
 * 'build-rdeps --only-main --old' is used to find package reverse build dependencies

### Advantages of this solution

If playbook execution fails - just ssh to the VM and fix the problem,
then re-run the playbook.
    $ ssh -p 2222 testvm@127.0.0.3

The playbooks are idempotent, therefore can be run unlimited amount of times.
The build avoidance is in place, so no packages will be built twice, unless build
artifacts are manually cleaned.
